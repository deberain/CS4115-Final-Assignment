# CS4115-Final-Assignment
The final graded assignment tasked to me as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms module in Second year at UL.

We were asked to take sample street data from OpenStreetMap and perform a number of operations on this data. For example, we had to represent the data internally in a more efficient structure than a regular n x n matrix, find the degree of a node, find the largest degree of any node in the data, find all neighbours that are k edges away from a node, and finding the shortest path between two nodes by total edge length or total number of edges. I accomplished this by implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm, though I could also have easily developed it into an A* algorithm using the xyz data from OpenStreetMap. 

The most significant requirement of this assignment was not just producing a program that would accomplish these tasks, but one that could do so in a more optimal manner. This demand proved to be challening but also very educational. I felt like I was truly being tested, as I pulled out all the tricks I could think of to optimise performance, such as passing objects to methods by reference to reduce costs involved with copying large lists of nodes.

Overall I felt this assignment assisted in polishing my C++ skills and my general mindset when it comes to programming. It proved to be a valuable experience where I could see the real life beneifts of what I was doing.
